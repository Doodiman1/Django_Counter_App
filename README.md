# Welcome to the Simple Django User Visits Tracker repository! 
This is a web application built using Django that allows users to visit the website as guests, create accounts, sign in, and keeps track of how many times each user has visited the website, as well as the total visits.

    ### Guest Access:
        Users can visit the website without logging in.

    ### User Registration:
        Users can create accounts by clicking on the "Sign Up" button and providing their details.

    ### User Authentication:
        Registered users can sign in using their credentials.

    ### User Visits Tracking:
        Each time a registered user logs in, their visit count is incremented.

    ### Total Visits Counter:
        The homepage displays the total number of visits by all users combined.
